# Processing Task 7 - Images and Animation

## Learning Objectives
In this task, you will learn about:
* drawing images
* animating images and shapes
* basic edge detection


## Step 1 - Lesson
Acquire the learning objectives by reviewing the following:

### Class Demo
* [Working Demo Code](https://github.com/mschen-sta/ICS3U1_Lesson_5_8_Processing_Image_Animation_Working_Demo)

### Happy Coding
from happycoding,io:
* [Images](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/images)
* [Animation](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/animation)
* [Collision Detection](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/collision-detection)

## Step 2 - Task
Demonstrate your learning objectives by writing a processing program that implements the following:

### Level 2
* Image background
* Animate an image
* Animate a shape

### Level 3
In addition to Level 2 requirements, incorporate basic edge collision detection such that your animated objects do not permenantly move off the screen.

### Level 4
In addtion to Level 3 requirements, animate an image so that it moves in a non-linear path (e.g. circular, wave, parabolic)

Check out https://www.kenney.nl/assets for an extensive collection of images for your animation.  Note that the site is blocked at school so you'll need to use a VPN or download the files from home.


## Submission
1. Commit and push your code to this repository
2. Take a **screen recording** of your animation and upload it to the Google Classroom assignment post
